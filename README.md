To run this Android sample provisioning app you need to:

- Connect your Android device to the wifi access point generated by an accessory device that is not provisioned. You do this via the device wifi manager.

- Make sure to enter the accessory PIN according to the specifications under which the PIN is stored in the device. In some cases you need to enter a hashed pin instead of clear pin.

- This sample app follows the Marvell HomeKit Accessory Kit SDK 0.10 specifications to provision non iOS devices.

- I created the app with Android Studio, but no Android Studio dependencies are checked in. The whole project is gradle based.
